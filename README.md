Gulp watchify example
---

This is a simple, hacky, example showing gulp and watchify working together to bundle multiple browserify bundles with shared external dependencies.
Know a better way to do this? Open an issue or send me an email :)

# Setup
```shell
npm i
```

# Start

```shell
# starts http-server and gulp task watching js files
npm start
```

# Test
```shell
# nope.
```
